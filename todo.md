# Todo

1) Resize current frame: For computation time + Memory

2)Write 3 codes for :
- Edge detection (ECR) 
- RBG value (SAD)
- Histogram (HD)

3)Calculate the Euclidean Distance of the current frame with the previous frame's of all 3 parts.

4)3 cases if statement stating who recognised shot change and what it was (hard cut, dissolve etc)

4)If the Euclidean Distance is greater than a given threshold, then we have a scene change.
