### PART 1
1) Resize current frame: For computation time + Memory

2) Write 3 codes for :
- Edge detection (ECR) 
- RBG value (SAD)
- Histogram (HD)

3) Calculate the Euclidean Distance of the current frame with the previous frame's of all 3 parts.

4) 3 cases if statement stating who recognised shot change and what it was (hard cut, dissolve etc)

5) If the Euclidean Distance is greater than a given threshold, then we have a scene change.

### PART 2
@ note: frame itself holds important information (spatial), frame relative to the frames before it in time (temporal).

1) make frames from clips
2) Rcnn to classify parts of 1 frame
3) hence get objects + humans info from images per clip

### PART 3
@ note: background music genre classify

1) see music classifiers, no knowlegde till now

### PART 4
@ note: webscraping to get data about the movie from net.
